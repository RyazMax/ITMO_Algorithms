\section*{Conclusion}

In this work direct methods and metaheuristic methods was used for unconstrained non-linear optimization task. 
According to observed results it can be said that metaheuristic methods as well as direct methods can be used
in optimization when it is not possible to use higher order methods because of unavailability of derivatives. Although,
metaheuristic are usually require more computations and as well as direct methods can converge to local optima.

As well as that metaheuristic methods can be used for descreate optimization i.e in Travelling Salesman Problem. In that work,
the Simulated annealing algorithm was used for solving TSP on Western Germany cities. The results showed that usage metaheuristic methods
can significantly decrease number of computations while receiving adequate sollutions.

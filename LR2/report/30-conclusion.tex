\section*{Conclusion}

In work was implemented one-dimensional and multidimensional direct methods of unconstrained nonlinear optimization, the implemented methods was 
used for solving approximations problem, compared to each other in terms of function evaluation counts and iteration required to find sollution.
According to the received results it can be noticed that brute-force (exhaustive) search method is most uneffective in terms of number of calculations, 
although it doest not require special constraints for function optimized.

Comparing dichotomy and golden-section method it can be noticed that the last one need less function evaluations while has the same constraints for optimized function.

In addition, it important to mention that due to unability of methods to find global optimum of function in general it is essential to choose good initial values and bounds of search.

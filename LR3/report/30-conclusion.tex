\section*{Conclusion}

In work was implemented first- and second-order methods of unconstrained nonlinear optimization, the implemented methods was 
used for solving approximations problem, compared to each other in terms of function evaluation counts and iteration required to find sollution.
According to the received results it can be noticed that both first-/second-order methods shows the better results (in terms of number of iterations) then direct-methods, however they require more information about optimized function (first and second order derivatives).

In addition, it important to mention that due to unability of methods to find global optimum of function in general it is essential to choose good initial values and bounds of search.

\section*{Conclusion}

In this work was observed different modification of algorithms solving minimum spanning tree problem: Kruskal and Prim algorithms.
The obtained results confirmed suggestions made in theoretical analysis of different modifications of algorithms, especialy for dense graphs.

The worst overall results were obtained by base Prim algorithm for both sparse and dense graphs, moreover it can be considered more difficult for implementation than base
Kruskal algorithm.

The best results for dense graphs were obtained from version of Prim algorithm for dense graphs, while it becomes significantly slower than other for sparse graphs.
For medium density graphs the best results received for Prim algorithm for sparse graphs.
In case of low density graphs the similar results received by sparse Prim and Kruskal with DSU algorithms, although the absolute time of execution can be depended on particular implementation.

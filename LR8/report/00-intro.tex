\section*{Formulation of problem}

\subsection*{Goal}

Practical analysis of advanced algorithms

\subsection*{Subtasks}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose 2 algorithms from next section of \textbf{Introduction to Algorithms} not considered in the course.
    \item Analyse the chosen algorithms in terms of time and space complexity, design techniques used, etc. Implement algorithms and produce several experiments.
\end{enumerate}

For this work was choosed algorithms for finding \textbf{minimum spanning trees}: Prim algorithm and Kruskal algorithm.

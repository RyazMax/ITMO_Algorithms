\section*{Conclusion}

In this work was used 2 representation of graph: adjacency matrix and adjacency list. And DFS and BFS algorithms was implemented
for adjacency list representation as it is more convient and more efficient and terms of elementary operations for sparse graphs.

With help of implemented algorithms connectivity components were found and shortest path to observed vertix.

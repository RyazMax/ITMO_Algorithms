\section*{Conclusion}

In this work used Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest way in the graph. The obtained results showed that 
Dijkstra algorithm is more efficient in terms of time on sparse graphs. Although, Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle negative cycles in graphs.

Also the A* algorithm was used as it allows to find distant specifically between 2 vertices in graph and has complexity better then Dijkstra algorithm for that case.

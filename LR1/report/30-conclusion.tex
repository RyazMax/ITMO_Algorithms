\section*{Conclusion}

In work was measured execution time of different implementations of algorithms given in tasks.
Obtained results shows that experimental time of execution can be described quite closely by theoretical model, 
although measurements contain noise due to other events affecting computer efficiency. Besides the fact that
the same implementation can be executed in different time on machines with different hardware the form of time execution 
keep the same and depends on algorithm. As well as that it can be noticed that theoretical expression of execution time shows closer results on
bigger size of input data.

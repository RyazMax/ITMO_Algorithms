\section*{Formulation of problem}

\subsection*{Goal}
The goal of current work is to study of the time complexity of different algorithms by conducting experiments on different input data.

\subsection*{Subtasks}

To achieve the goal different algorithms implementations execution time was measured and compared with its theoretical value. 
Next subtasks was solved:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $f(v) = const$
    \item $f(v) = \Sigma_{k=1}^{n} v_k$
    \item $f(v) = \Pi_{k=1}^{n} v_k $
    \item $f(v) = \Sigma_{k=1}^{n} v_kx^{k - 1}$, also with Horner's method
    \item Bubble sort
    \item Quick Sort
    \item Timsort
    \item Matrix product of 2 square matrices size of $ n\times n$ 
\end{itemize}

Where $v$ is n-dimensional random vector with non-negative elements. In every subtask $n=\overline{1,2000}$, except
the task with matrices product due to long execution time, in that case the maximum n was of 1000.
